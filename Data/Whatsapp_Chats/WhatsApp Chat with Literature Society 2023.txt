09/06/23, 11:52 - +91 76749 18469: its the lack of family guy clips at the bottom of the screen

09/06/23, 11:55 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: It's about hmm what is a woman
09/06/23, 11:56 - +91 76749 18469: this is my favourite video essay ever, i cannot shill it enough
09/06/23, 11:56 - +91 76749 18469: lmfao
09/06/23, 11:56 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: What do trans ppl feel when they say they feel like a woman
09/06/23, 11:56 - +91 76749 18469: oh
09/06/23, 11:56 - +91 76749 18469: ohhhh
09/06/23, 11:56 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: My body is the only body i have been in
09/06/23, 11:56 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: So how do I know what it feels to be a woman
And how do I know ki i am not trans
09/06/23, 12:00 - +91 83560 68082: I think it's more about a social identity than something which is only felt by you
09/06/23, 12:00 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: And that being???
09/06/23, 12:00 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Ha mtlb i completely got ur point
09/06/23, 12:01 - +91 83560 68082: Hmm..hard to put into way
09/06/23, 12:01 - +91 83560 68082: It could be gender is a way to just express yourself in a society
09/06/23, 12:01 - +91 76749 18469: isn't the main reason body dysmorphia, and that's personal right?
09/06/23, 12:01 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: My query is what is the umbrella of expressions/emotions that makes a man a man and a woman woman wrt social construct that gender is
09/06/23, 12:02 - +91 83560 68082: Personally, I don't think so that's the case based on my experience
09/06/23, 12:02 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Ha yes that is partly correct
09/06/23, 12:03 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: But gender dysmorphia is very rare
It's the absolute repulsive  feeling one gets from their body
Fun fact: it may not always be gender
09/06/23, 12:03 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: The question was targetted at the more liberal approach to transgenderism that there exists today
09/06/23, 12:03 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Anyone can be woman
09/06/23, 12:03 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Men can have periods too
09/06/23, 12:03 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: That sort of narrative
09/06/23, 12:04 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: U getting ??
09/06/23, 12:04 - +91 83560 68082: Something that genderfluid people would say is that gender is not something rigid. Maybe you are a woman from someone's perspective, and a man from mine. Or a bisexual from someone else's.
09/06/23, 12:04 - +91 76749 18469: sorry, it's dysphoria, and that is very common, i think, atleast from what i read on trans subreddits, lots of people seem to have it
09/06/23, 12:05 - +91 76749 18469: kinda
09/06/23, 12:05 - +91 76749 18469: i dont like reading this tbh, this somehow downplays what being a woman is
09/06/23, 12:06 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Ha okay got your point
But when they say they feel feminine what is it that they are feeling 
Are the referring to the aura associated with "gender roles"
I feel kawai 
I feel cooldood6969
09/06/23, 12:06 - +91 83560 68082: Just a thought, who is a woman according to you?
09/06/23, 12:07 - +91 76749 18469: depends on the context, as a social construct anyone can be a woman, biologically people with the XX chromosome should be considered a woman
09/06/23, 12:07 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Thanks for correcting
When i said about how rare it is
I mean the numbers
1 in 70k to 1 in 110k (atleast in western population)
09/06/23, 12:07 - +91 76749 18469: they just want to wear skirts xD
09/06/23, 12:08 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Ha exactly cz being woman is not just about periods right???
09/06/23, 12:08 - +91 76749 18469: i see, but the numbers talk is misleading imo, very less people have cancer in percentage, but it's important to talk about
09/06/23, 12:08 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: So that is out of question
What is a woman
~some who gets periods~
Then what is a woman
09/06/23, 12:09 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Are again ye semantically infiltrate kyu kr rha mughko üò≠üò≠
09/06/23, 12:09 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: I am not transphobic bhai
09/06/23, 12:09 - +91 76749 18469: everything that women have been experiencing until now, collectively makes up what a woman is imo, some people on this side want what people on the other side are getting, so they're jumping fence, overtime the meaning changes i think
09/06/23, 12:09 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: XD
09/06/23, 12:10 - +91 76749 18469: right now there's nothing tho xd
09/06/23, 12:10 - +91 83560 68082: The proper answer would be that depends on who you ask; tho I would say I would identify myself as a woman if I suddenly started feeling kawaii
09/06/23, 12:10 - +91 76749 18469: lmao sorry but i just think wo numbers ka argument is irrelevant prolly
09/06/23, 12:10 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Hmmm feels like an ouroboros or however it is spelled
09/06/23, 12:11 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Define women without using women and related terms
09/06/23, 12:11 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Acha chalo i come to u
09/06/23, 12:11 - +91 83560 68082: Woman is a gender, female is sex. Gender can be anything, but sex is definite
09/06/23, 12:11 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: And i say he i think something is suspicious with me and i want to explore my gender
09/06/23, 12:11 - +91 76749 18469: that is a defintion i think most people agree with including me, people dont use those words like that always tho
09/06/23, 12:12 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: I saw Kakashi with black nail paint and got mine painted black too
I have butterflies sticked on my hostel walls and i used to like when my sister used to do makeup practices on me
09/06/23, 12:12 - +91 83560 68082: Yep
09/06/23, 12:12 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: And i trans
How do I know what a woman is
09/06/23, 12:13 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: What are the boxes i need to cross to conform to a said gender category
09/06/23, 12:13 - Aaditya Senior: why r u
09/06/23, 12:13 - Aaditya Senior: ge
09/06/23, 12:13 - +91 76749 18469: you just want to be treated by everyone around how they treat your sister
09/06/23, 12:13 - +91 76749 18469: as much as possible
09/06/23, 12:13 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Hmmm nice nice nice
09/06/23, 12:14 - +91 83560 68082: You can absolutely cross no boxes and still be included in said gender. Cause gender is upto your interpretation
09/06/23, 12:14 - +91 76749 18469: honestly, the modern definition of gender is very very selfish imo, but there's nothing wrong with that, i just wish people were nicer about it
09/06/23, 12:14 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: But back to square 1
Bear with me
09/06/23, 12:14 - Aaditya Senior: its a misjudgement on your part i would like to debate but it‚Äôs gonna go very mentalistic south
09/06/23, 12:14 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Okay??
09/06/23, 12:14 - +91 76749 18469: i challenge you to xd
09/06/23, 12:14 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Gender again as said by you are social constructs
Agreed
09/06/23, 12:14 - +91 83560 68082: Yep
09/06/23, 12:15 - +91 76749 18469: this is selfish and irrational imo
09/06/23, 12:15 - Aaditya Senior: but but they are derived from the natural phenomenon of attraction na
09/06/23, 12:15 - +91 83560 68082: Elaborate
09/06/23, 12:15 - +91 76749 18469: if you alienate everyone around you who's going to treat you lhow you wanted to be treated like? üò≠
09/06/23, 12:15 - Aaditya Senior: see the occurrence of lgbtq and the boom
09/06/23, 12:15 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: But social constructs exist to aid society
Aise toh achi gadi hai
Kitni pyari kursi hai
Kitna bhayanak ped hai
09/06/23, 12:15 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: They have gender in hindi
09/06/23, 12:15 - +91 83560 68082: I mean you can be an asexual woman
09/06/23, 12:16 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Not in english
09/06/23, 12:16 - Aaditya Senior: has mostly been due to confirmational bias
09/06/23, 12:16 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: And y should sm1 have unki Marzi ke pronouns
Aise toh i will have my adjectives abhi
09/06/23, 12:16 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: They are gonna 
Handsome and sexy
09/06/23, 12:16 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: üò≠üò≠
09/06/23, 12:16 - +91 76749 18469: yeah, the whole argument comes from blurry social constructs are
09/06/23, 12:16 - +91 76749 18469: adjectives are objective, more or less
09/06/23, 12:16 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Yup yup
09/06/23, 12:17 - Aaditya Senior: example:
Someday a man felt warm feeling towards another man

Anither day he hears there is smg like ‚Äúgay‚Äù now he is directed to think that he is gay
09/06/23, 12:17 - +91 76749 18469: and they are much more objective than pronouns, atleast üò≠
09/06/23, 12:17 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Exactly üò≠üò≠
Ja rha insta bio change karne
09/06/23, 12:17 - +91 76749 18469: bullshit imo üò≠ with that logic same sex relationships are confirmational bias too
09/06/23, 12:18 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: I am comming out as handsome/sexy
09/06/23, 12:18 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: üòãüòã
09/06/23, 12:18 - +91 76749 18469: gay people have been existing for so long
09/06/23, 12:18 - +91 76749 18469: odysseus wrote gay romance
09/06/23, 12:18 - +91 76749 18469: i mean
09/06/23, 12:18 - Aaditya Senior: they are who knows

why wasnt it so prevalent in 1800 CE
09/06/23, 12:18 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: I feel that is a different thing
09/06/23, 12:18 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Because stigma
09/06/23, 12:18 - Aaditya Senior: why only now
blame the age of information
09/06/23, 12:18 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: They would be beaten to death
09/06/23, 12:18 - +91 76749 18469: greek people had femboys in their courts
09/06/23, 12:18 - Aaditya Senior: nope
09/06/23, 12:19 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Cite your sources
09/06/23, 12:19 - +91 76749 18469: real
09/06/23, 12:19 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Yep
09/06/23, 12:19 - Aaditya Senior: because of lack of evidence and information to support the backing of a person feelings
09/06/23, 12:19 - Aaditya Senior: but today
09/06/23, 12:19 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Ha theek okay 
Back then i would have thought something's wrong with me
09/06/23, 12:19 - Aaditya Senior: there are 10 ppl to interpret and explain whatever the hell i am feeling
09/06/23, 12:19 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Abhi i know ki it's natural
09/06/23, 12:19 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Got nothing to do with number of gays
09/06/23, 12:20 - +91 76749 18469: yes
09/06/23, 12:20 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: It's only the number of ppl who came to realization thats different
09/06/23, 12:20 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Apple fell to ground since time immemorial
09/06/23, 12:20 - +91 76749 18469: i feel like, the existence of pregnancy and having a child is what made the difference
09/06/23, 12:20 - Aaditya Senior: Exactly maybe its not natural 
but sonce you have seen it accepted and confirmed around you so much ki it seems its natural
09/06/23, 12:20 - Aaditya Senior: imo LGBTQ is a stunt
09/06/23, 12:20 - +91 96965 45056: Well, sociologically speaking, the whole LGBT+ thing is socially made. And we as people only have feelings, someone isn't gay by birth, they conform to a social norm to be gay.
09/06/23, 12:21 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: I can back my claims
09/06/23, 12:21 - +91 83560 68082: Yes yes..there are no said 'restrictions' as such. But if you genuinely feel handsome/sexy are suitable, then no one can stop you. If you are deriving what you are based on your emotions, there is nothing wrong or right to be pointed out. At most, one can criticise it logically
09/06/23, 12:21 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Can you
09/06/23, 12:21 - +91 83560 68082: Yep
09/06/23, 12:21 - Aaditya Senior: agree
09/06/23, 12:21 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Yes queen
Go off
09/06/23, 12:22 - +91 83560 68082: But 'right' or 'wrong' isn't  defined in this case
09/06/23, 12:22 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: Agreed üôåüèª
09/06/23, 12:22 - +91 76749 18469: you can apply the same logic to cis people as well right?
09/06/23, 12:22 - +91 76749 18469: only difference being, the numbers
09/06/23, 12:22 - Aaditya Senior: From someone who does not consider emotions into picture (me)

Its all do in rome as the romans do turned propaganda
09/06/23, 12:22 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: So u r asex

09/06/23, 12:23 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: Ded
09/06/23, 12:23 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Fall of the mighty
09/06/23, 12:23 - Aaditya Senior: i identify as a dinosaur
09/06/23, 12:23 - +91 96965 45056: Well, maybe it isn't, but the feelings of people aren't, anyone can like any gender, and anyone can be any gender. Also, the struggle of people facing discrimination everyday is real, and maybe that is why they have made something called LGBT+, so that they can conform and find a community.
09/06/23, 12:23 - +91 83560 68082: What pronouns tho
09/06/23, 12:23 - Aaditya Senior: rawr/bam
09/06/23, 12:23 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: Dityrranosaur
09/06/23, 12:24 - +91 76749 18469: omg, nice reply
09/06/23, 12:24 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Ha na

09/06/23, 12:24 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Individuality
09/06/23, 12:24 - +91 83560 68082: I feel the whole concept of identification today is just finding somewhere to fit in
09/06/23, 12:24 - Aaditya Senior: Dity is short form for Dino Kitty
09/06/23, 12:24 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: You are not attracted to a gender but a set of traits
09/06/23, 12:24 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Traits found in a said gender??
09/06/23, 12:24 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Cool
09/06/23, 12:24 - Prithvi Kiran IITJ CS: i agree
09/06/23, 12:24 - +91 96965 45056: Yeah, true
09/06/23, 12:24 - +91 76749 18469: traits which were the attributes of a gender construct as well
09/06/23, 12:25 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: Not to the whole but a subset of features?
09/06/23, 12:25 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: I like muscle mommies and Miguel ohara
09/06/23, 12:25 - +91 76749 18469: it's also a bit more selfish than that lol, also add the concept of being percieved and treated how you wanna
09/06/23, 12:25 - +91 76749 18469: based
09/06/23, 12:26 - +91 83560 68082: I would say it's self centered
09/06/23, 12:26 - +91 83560 68082: I mean who is to decide what is to call you other than you
09/06/23, 12:26 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: 4am thoughts moment hone wala
09/06/23, 12:26 - Aaditya Senior: I understand your point 
and to some degree agree to
but, when we say words like anyone and anyone and try to validate it ‚Äúpolitically‚Äù or enforce ‚Äúadversarially‚Äù arent we opening doors to absurdity
09/06/23, 12:26 - +91 76749 18469: yeah, "we're just finding a place to fit in" is kinda dishonest
09/06/23, 12:26 - +91 96965 45056: Maybe you are projecting now. But people are not only attracted to traits, but also gender. If someone is attracted to females, doesn't necessarily mean that they will be attracted to males having feminine traits
09/06/23, 12:27 - +91 83560 68082: Hmm..elaborate
09/06/23, 12:27 - Aaditya Senior: me doing this in my work hours
09/06/23, 12:27 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Chalo valid
09/06/23, 12:28 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: Good point.. like I said we are talking about a subset of characters when we define these genders.. but the concept of attraction does not revolve around subsets.
09/06/23, 12:28 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: <Media omitted>
09/06/23, 12:28 - +91 96965 45056: Yeah, you are right. I shouldn't use anyone. Let me correct it, one can like any gender, and one can be any gender if they feel to identify as one.
09/06/23, 12:28 - +91 76749 18469: no xD
09/06/23, 12:29 - +91 83560 68082: Cring
09/06/23, 12:29 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: How would you explain this to your supervisor ? Just wanna know :) üòÇ
09/06/23, 12:30 - Aaditya Senior: Define one
09/06/23, 12:30 - Aaditya Senior: where do we draw the line
09/06/23, 12:31 - Aaditya Senior: I will give you a few examples
09/06/23, 12:31 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Why do we need to??
09/06/23, 12:31 - Aaditya Senior: Elaborating the absurdity
09/06/23, 12:31 - Aaditya Senior: Lets say abu is a citizen of US
09/06/23, 12:31 - Aaditya Senior: i marry abu
09/06/23, 12:32 - Aaditya Senior: identifying gay
09/06/23, 12:32 - Aaditya Senior: we divorce
09/06/23, 12:32 - Aaditya Senior: now lawfully
09/06/23, 12:32 - +91 96965 45056: One who feels mentally calmer and happier, to identify as a particular gender, may identify as one
09/06/23, 12:32 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: <Media omitted>
09/06/23, 12:32 - Aaditya Senior: im an US citizen
09/06/23, 12:32 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: I mean u can marry a women
09/06/23, 12:32 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Of US
09/06/23, 12:32 - +91 96965 45056: Yeah, so?
09/06/23, 12:32 - Aaditya Senior: 10000 dollars
09/06/23, 12:32 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: U don't need to be gay for that
09/06/23, 12:32 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: Hypothetical
09/06/23, 12:32 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Infact
09/06/23, 12:32 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Infact
09/06/23, 12:32 - Aaditya Senior: and skipped all the bullshit
09/06/23, 12:33 - +91 96965 45056: What 10000 dollars?
09/06/23, 12:33 - Aaditya Senior: Imagine the gates of absurdity
09/06/23, 12:33 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Ye shadi fir green card fir divorce has got nothing to do with sex
09/06/23, 12:33 - Aaditya Senior: to marry and to divorce lol
09/06/23, 12:33 - +91 96965 45056: ++
09/06/23, 12:34 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: It's the same bull and cock argument ppl make with invest and bestialty
09/06/23, 12:34 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Incest*
09/06/23, 12:34 - +91 96965 45056: What absurdity? Anyone can do that with a woman as well, there's nothing special if you are gay in that situation
09/06/23, 12:34 - Aaditya Senior: Between a married couple
09/06/23, 12:35 - Aaditya Senior: the information is prejudicial
09/06/23, 12:35 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: Care to explain ?
09/06/23, 12:35 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: It projects ur preconceived notion ki become gay for green card is bizzare
Well honey trapping for green card is also bizzare
09/06/23, 12:35 - Aaditya Senior: to prevent yourself from committing a perjury in court
09/06/23, 12:35 - Aaditya Senior: just marry the other guy
09/06/23, 12:35 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Ur is referred to aaditya
09/06/23, 12:35 - Aaditya Senior: and gg
09/06/23, 12:36 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: And that is a failure of personal relations
09/06/23, 12:36 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Nothing to with what's in my pants
09/06/23, 12:37 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Mtlb kya gay marriages me perjury nahi hoti kya??üò≠üò≠
09/06/23, 12:38 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: And to an extent yes
09/06/23, 12:38 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Cz laws are not recognised
09/06/23, 12:38 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Which is y their representation is required????
09/06/23, 12:38 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: üëÄ
09/06/23, 12:40 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Summing things up
Before we ask what 59 women are
We should ask who and how those 59 women are
09/06/23, 12:40 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Bye guys
Good talk
09/06/23, 12:42 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Asufutimaehaehfutbw
09/06/23, 12:43 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: iykyk
09/06/23, 12:43 - +91 76749 18469: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvA-Vf0MomM
09/06/23, 12:43 - +91 76749 18469: 1.7M people know xd
09/06/23, 12:44 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: Lol
09/06/23, 14:28 - Aaditya Senior: im just saying
09/06/23, 14:28 - Aaditya Senior: ki more possiblity to
09/06/23, 14:28 - Aaditya Senior: and if attraction was the thing
09/06/23, 14:28 - Aaditya Senior: i would like to say 
ones primal urges to copulate should not define a person
09/06/23, 14:29 - Aaditya Senior: they way this LGBTQ has been hinged on personal identity
09/06/23, 14:29 - Aaditya Senior: People have stopped seeing others as ‚Äúpeople‚Äù
09/06/23, 14:30 - Aaditya Senior: every one is a walking gender tag now
09/06/23, 14:33 - +91 96965 45056: Let people do what they want to. If you don't want to walk being a gender tag, then DO NOT be a gender tag. And also, there are many people who still aren't a walking gender tag. Now you are the one generalizing people, saying EVERYONE.
09/06/23, 14:33 - Aaditya Senior: That what is said
09/06/23, 14:33 - Aaditya Senior: gates to absurdity
09/06/23, 14:34 - Aaditya Senior: Now lets say I identify as a woman
09/06/23, 14:34 - Aaditya Senior: And want to use ladies washroom
09/06/23, 14:34 - Aaditya Senior: How many would be comfortable with it
09/06/23, 14:34 - +91 96965 45056: Okay
09/06/23, 14:34 - +91 96965 45056: Please go and use it
09/06/23, 14:34 - +91 96965 45056: If you want to, soo bad
09/06/23, 14:35 - Aaditya Senior: There are perverse people lurking all around
09/06/23, 14:35 - +91 96965 45056: Come on, if trans men started going to the female washroom, you are the one who would be uncomfortable them
09/06/23, 14:35 - Aaditya Senior: why would they not use this
09/06/23, 14:36 - Aaditya Senior: Abhi take the very recent example of women‚Äôs sports
09/06/23, 14:36 - +91 96965 45056: For those small fraction of people, you cannot stop the freedom of the masses
09/06/23, 14:36 - Aaditya Senior: The point is
09/06/23, 14:37 - +91 96965 45056: If was talking about trans men who have undergone transition
09/06/23, 14:37 - +91 96965 45056: No, thats not the point. We aren't a small fraction, we are about 10% of all people
09/06/23, 14:37 - +91 96965 45056: You know what that means
09/06/23, 14:38 - Aaditya Senior: The small fraction you are referring to
Trans people were that small fraction ones
now they are masses
09/06/23, 14:39 - Aaditya Senior: once*
09/06/23, 14:39 - Aaditya Senior: Imagine the perverse fraction going
09/06/23, 14:39 - Aaditya Senior: growing *
09/06/23, 14:40 - Aaditya Senior: Is it not in the scope of possibility?
09/06/23, 14:40 - Aaditya Senior: I believe it is
09/06/23, 14:40 - +91 96965 45056: No, they were always there, and they were not a small fraction at any time. They were just closeted, so people like you wouldn't ostracize them
09/06/23, 14:40 - Aaditya Senior: I am not against LGBTQ
09/06/23, 14:40 - Aaditya Senior: i never was
09/06/23, 14:41 - Aaditya Senior: but There has to be a line on what their demands are
09/06/23, 14:41 - Aaditya Senior: Perverts are closeted too?
09/06/23, 14:41 - Aaditya Senior: aren‚Äôt they
09/06/23, 14:42 - +91 96965 45056: Well, it is. But if someone has to go to the ladies bathroom, they can go and do horrible things, even if they aren't men. Stop talking as if men are inherently evil
09/06/23, 14:42 - Aaditya Senior: üòÇ
09/06/23, 14:42 - +91 96965 45056: Ohh, I don't know if you're fooling me or yourself ü§£
09/06/23, 14:42 - Aaditya Senior: In my defence im a man and fully aware that i am not inherently evil
09/06/23, 14:43 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Guys let's racially profile people 
Read: black cz most of the homicidal cases are registered in their name
09/06/23, 14:43 - Aaditya Senior: I will cut to the chase
09/06/23, 14:43 - Aaditya Senior: and put my point again
09/06/23, 14:44 - Aaditya Senior: .
09/06/23, 14:44 - Aaditya Senior: .
09/06/23, 14:44 - +91 96965 45056: So, let them use the washroom, just let them, if someone stops you, then say that you identify as a woman
09/06/23, 14:44 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: It does not
09/06/23, 14:44 - +91 96965 45056: ++
09/06/23, 14:44 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: But in India u can have home loans
09/06/23, 14:44 - Aaditya Senior: Thats the whole point
09/06/23, 14:45 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: U cannot have so many things if u do not conform to a said bracket
09/06/23, 14:45 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: But if and when i go out asking for rights
09/06/23, 14:45 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Do not make me the Rani laxmibai of gays
09/06/23, 14:45 - Aaditya Senior: LGBT+ is not the biggest topic of discussion and someone should make pro activists understand that
09/06/23, 14:46 - Aaditya Senior: The very reason of having this discussion originates from it
09/06/23, 14:46 - +91 96965 45056: No, its not. LGBT is not just all tags, its so many real things. You cannot kiss in the public like hetero people, you cannot marry legally to have home loans, like Abu said, etc. Its so many real things.
09/06/23, 14:46 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Ha for us yes
(Considering none of us are LGBTQ )
09/06/23, 14:46 - Aaditya Senior: In up
09/06/23, 14:46 - Aaditya Senior: you just cannot kiss in public
09/06/23, 14:46 - Aaditya Senior: thats more of a general society issue
09/06/23, 14:46 - +91 96965 45056: Heteronormativity at its peak
09/06/23, 14:47 - Aaditya Senior: Pinging that too to LGBT
09/06/23, 14:47 - Aaditya Senior: i must say my point becomes more valid
09/06/23, 14:47 - +91 96965 45056: I am not talking about UP only, and you know that
09/06/23, 14:48 - +91 96965 45056: Just because a problem isn't the biggest, doesn't mean that it stops being a problem and it doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to prevent it
09/06/23, 14:49 - Pragati Sinha B22 IITJ: this is more of a thing when
09/06/23, 14:49 - Pragati Sinha B22 IITJ: a woman is transitioning biologically into a man
09/06/23, 14:49 - Aaditya Senior: oh we are discussing it
09/06/23, 14:50 - Aaditya Senior: but the thing is
09/06/23, 14:50 - Aaditya Senior: we are only discussing it
09/06/23, 14:50 - Pragati Sinha B22 IITJ: and they get periods for a while till the fully transition
09/06/23, 14:50 - Pragati Sinha B22 IITJ: hormones thing
09/06/23, 14:50 - Pragati Sinha B22 IITJ: afaik
09/06/23, 14:51 - Pragati Sinha B22 IITJ: wow i‚Äôm vvv late lmfao
09/06/23, 14:51 - +91 96965 45056: No, it can also happen to intersex people, who have secondary sexual characteristics of men, or who identify as men
09/06/23, 14:51 - Pragati Sinha B22 IITJ: ha yes that too
09/06/23, 14:51 - Aman Thakur B20 IITJ: That's why gender neutral restrooms are a thing
09/06/23, 14:52 - Pragati Sinha B22 IITJ: should be a thing everywhere tbh
09/06/23, 14:52 - +91 96965 45056: Don't you guys mostly talk about other things?
09/06/23, 14:53 - Aaditya Senior: Accha tell me one thing
09/06/23, 14:53 - Aaditya Senior: what are LGBTQ still fighting for?
09/06/23, 14:54 - +91 96965 45056: For marriage, for equality
09/06/23, 14:54 - Aaditya Senior: vo to hogy
09/06/23, 14:54 - Aaditya Senior: equalty? bruh they have proper reservations afaik
09/06/23, 14:54 - +91 96965 45056: Marriage kaha huyi? Aur equality matlab sirf recognition nahi hota?
09/06/23, 14:54 - +91 96965 45056: Bhai, where????
09/06/23, 14:54 - Aaditya Senior: its one thing to be equal
09/06/23, 14:54 - Aaditya Senior: another to be fair
09/06/23, 14:55 - +91 96965 45056: Yeah, I have seen those insta posts
09/06/23, 14:55 - Aaditya Senior: how many companies did u apply to lately?
09/06/23, 14:55 - +91 96965 45056: Many many

09/06/23, 14:55 - +91 96965 45056: Everyone said sorry
09/06/23, 14:55 - +91 96965 45056: ü´†ü´†
09/06/23, 14:55 - Aaditya Senior: 4000 of them
09/06/23, 14:56 - Aaditya Senior: had reservations
09/06/23, 14:56 - +91 96965 45056: For?
09/06/23, 14:56 - Aaditya Senior: we celebrate a fucking pride month
09/06/23, 14:56 - Pragati Sinha B22 IITJ: mughals
09/06/23, 14:56 - Aaditya Senior: so i will ask again
09/06/23, 14:56 - +91 96965 45056: You don't celebrate please, if you don't want to
09/06/23, 14:56 - +91 96965 45056: Let me celebrate
09/06/23, 14:56 - +91 96965 45056: I like it
09/06/23, 14:57 - Aaditya Senior: You can launch a personal attack by saying ‚Äúyou‚Äù and ‚Äúme‚Äù
09/06/23, 14:57 - Aaditya Senior: does not end the argument
09/06/23, 14:57 - Aaditya Senior: .
09/06/23, 14:58 - +91 96965 45056: But one can just avoid it if one wants. Let those be happy who have hidden themselves whole year
09/06/23, 14:58 - Aaditya Senior: Quite far fetched
09/06/23, 14:58 - Aaditya Senior: but thike
09/06/23, 14:59 - Aaditya Senior: If you are happy so be it
09/06/23, 14:59 - Aaditya Senior: Tho i will have to ask
09/06/23, 15:00 - Aaditya Senior: How many combinations of Gender/sex do people want
09/06/23, 15:01 - Aaditya Senior: From what i understood (biologically speaking) it should have ended at 8
09/06/23, 15:01 - +91 96965 45056: You don't have to care about it if you don't want to
09/06/23, 15:02 - +91 96965 45056: Let people call themselves anything
09/06/23, 15:02 - Aaditya Senior: Han true i dont want to fight that
09/06/23, 15:02 - Aaditya Senior: But if everytime you identify with something new
09/06/23, 15:02 - Pragati Sinha B22 IITJ: no
09/06/23, 15:03 - Aaditya Senior: and ask rights for it
09/06/23, 15:03 - Aaditya Senior: Ask edges and advantages for it
09/06/23, 15:03 - Aaditya Senior: ask equality for it
09/06/23, 15:03 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Sex based????
09/06/23, 15:03 - Aaditya Senior: yep
09/06/23, 15:03 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Naa
09/06/23, 15:03 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Not believing
09/06/23, 15:04 - Aaditya Senior: Well this whole discussion is on belief so i won‚Äôt challenge
09/06/23, 15:04 - Aaditya Senior: You can not
09/06/23, 15:04 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Lmao
09/06/23, 15:04 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Cite karo
09/06/23, 15:04 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: That's what I meant by not believing
09/06/23, 15:05 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: I don't want
09/06/23, 15:05 - Aaditya Senior: You have to understand that there are limited resources
09/06/23, 15:05 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: But ppl who are of the said orientation
09/06/23, 15:05 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: They want
09/06/23, 15:05 - Aaditya Senior: And every new ask
09/06/23, 15:05 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: And ??
09/06/23, 15:05 - Aaditya Senior: is at someone dividend
09/06/23, 15:06 - Aaditya Senior: someones*
09/06/23, 15:06 - +91 96965 45056: Arre, no one asks for rights for something new. Trans and intersex people were always real, and so they asked for reservations. No one else is asking for that
09/06/23, 15:06 - Pragati Sinha B22 IITJ: wild assumption
09/06/23, 15:06 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Someone's???
09/06/23, 15:06 - Aaditya Senior: Disagree

09/06/23, 15:09 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: To the wrongs they did
09/06/23, 15:09 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: To us asking for Kohinoor back
09/06/23, 15:09 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Or the West Bengal famine
09/06/23, 15:09 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Yes they left India but didn't undo the damage

09/06/23, 15:10 - Aaditya Senior: It should be about balancing the scales in the ‚Äúpresent ‚Äú rather than equating all with the past
09/06/23, 15:10 - Aaditya Senior: What would you have them do
09/06/23, 15:11 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Return Kohinoor
Then okay 5 trillion was looted 
Not that sum but an acknowledgement apology

09/06/23, 15:11 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Okay
09/06/23, 15:11 - +91 96965 45056: We are not equating the past, we are just balancing the scales in the present. We are giving the rights that cishet people already have to LGBT people too
09/06/23, 15:11 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: And then u said it urself *i don't think*
09/06/23, 15:12 - Aaditya Senior: I guess an apology should suffice
09/06/23, 15:12 - Aaditya Senior: Kohinoor does not make an economic difference
09/06/23, 15:12 - +91 96965 45056: "I guess"
09/06/23, 15:12 - Aaditya Senior: And as for 5 trillion

09/06/23, 15:12 - Aaditya Senior: Does india need it

09/06/23, 15:13 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Jallianwala bagh
09/06/23, 15:13 - Aaditya Senior: Things did happen

09/06/23, 15:14 - Aaditya Senior: Asking for reperations to whom
Praying on an era that had no involvement whatsoever
09/06/23, 15:15 - Aaditya Senior: It‚Äôs stupid at best
09/06/23, 15:15 - +91 96965 45056: Well, it won't. But an apology and a pledge to not interfere in any country's sovereignty would be a good first step. Giving the stone back would mean that they understand their mistake and wish they could undo it.
09/06/23, 15:15 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: The lady who was at a time technically queen of British India died a few years back
09/06/23, 15:15 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: So no
09/06/23, 15:15 - Aaditya Senior: What did I say
09/06/23, 15:16 - Aaditya Senior: An apology should suffice
09/06/23, 15:16 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Chalo for a start yess
09/06/23, 15:16 - Aaditya Senior: and Kohinoor does not make an economic difference
09/06/23, 15:16 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: But are we getting it?
09/06/23, 15:16 - Aaditya Senior: But 5 trillion does
09/06/23, 15:16 - +91 96965 45056: Suffice and a first step are two different things
09/06/23, 15:16 - Aaditya Senior: Are we asking for it?
09/06/23, 15:16 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Are we getting any of it???
09/06/23, 15:17 - +91 96965 45056: Yes
09/06/23, 15:17 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Yes we are bhai
09/06/23, 15:17 - Aaditya Senior: If you ho for the neck before you clutch the hand
09/06/23, 15:17 - Aaditya Senior: its not equality it‚Äôs revenge
09/06/23, 15:17 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Theek hai agreed
09/06/23, 15:17 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Extremism goes both ways
09/06/23, 15:17 - Aaditya Senior: It does
09/06/23, 15:17 - Aaditya Senior: And it is
09/06/23, 15:17 - +91 96965 45056: I'm not that good in Idioms and phrases. Could you please explain
09/06/23, 15:18 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: But why are simple liberal hard-to-wrap-head-around narratives getting purged
09/06/23, 15:18 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Let them marry

09/06/23, 15:18 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Let them have a joint account
09/06/23, 15:18 - Aaditya Senior: True let them
09/06/23, 15:18 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Let them have each other as nominees of PF
09/06/23, 15:18 - +91 96965 45056: But giving the same perks to everyone is not extremism. So why comparing both situations?
09/06/23, 15:18 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Let them but health insurance
09/06/23, 15:18 - Aaditya Senior: But societal norms are to be introduced gradually
09/06/23, 15:19 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: It's these things that they are demanding for
09/06/23, 15:19 - +91 96965 45056: Why gradually?
09/06/23, 15:19 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Gradually theek

09/06/23, 15:20 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Let's not give right to work to women
09/06/23, 15:20 - Pragati Sinha B22 IITJ: this is gradual tho
09/06/23, 15:20 - Pragati Sinha B22 IITJ: 377 was legalised in 2018
09/06/23, 15:20 - Aaditya Senior: Marriage is a much sacred order for many people
09/06/23, 15:20 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Cz what if they start roaming streets and get assaulted
09/06/23, 15:20 - Pragati Sinha B22 IITJ: the fight for same sex marriage has been going on since 2010-11

11/06/23, 12:01 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Attempt to an Experience

A starry sky and a moon in gibbous 
Venus was shining bright,
And amidst them, sitting on the aisle
I breathed in as my plane took off in the night

And as I flew within the twinkling sky
The ground below me glittered
For in the night of the starry sight
The man-made lights on the ground, too, flickered

And as the morning star shone brighter, 
The light of the moon started to fade
Appeared a new light in the starry sky 
And sky itself turned a new shade

And while admiring this gradient
Suddenly, I experienced this particular annoyance
For had interrupted my deep lonesome penance
A gorgeous entity, tapping my shoulder like tuning clairvoyance 

Seeing her abysmal eyes and obsidian hair,
As if drowning within and yet peace reside,
The scenery outside fading in comparison
To the diva within, about to sit me beside

And yet looking at her distrustful rosy smile
I think I lost myself for a second.
‚ÄòDo you mind?‚Äô shattered my austerity,
Might have been a ‚Äòfive minutes,‚Äô if I reckon.

‚ÄòDo you mind, If I sit beside the window?‚Äô
She asked, looking at the empty window seat.
‚ÄòNot at all,‚Äô I said, stepping into the aisle
Trying to subdue my accelerating heartbeat

‚ÄòWell, Thanks! it is the sunrise you see.‚Äô
She entered the row beside me
Kindling thus, a hearty conversation
An open heart one- phew! Blimey!

And thus, ranging through various topics.
Philosophies, Books, and Postulates
And as the conversation reached its peak,
The plane landed just to invade

And what I imagined to be a sudden ‚Äòthe end‚Äô
Ended as a new fresh start
For a quick exchange of contacts, followed through
As the passengers did start to depart
--
She left quickly as she had come
Turning twice, looking at me, smiling
And I smiled back, responding with one quick short waive
And she walked away into the upcoming horizon lining

Thus, as we started a journey alone
In a lonesome starry winking weather
In a conspicuous way among stars, it did happen
For the Sun had brought us together.

15/06/23, 22:01 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Love or Happiness?

Sitting under an oak together
As I looked upon her eyes
Tender yet firm gazing
As the red leaves in the air flies

And spending such time with her
Giving me an internal fulfilling-calm
Breaking me from a trance, a giggle
As while gazing at her, a leaf rested upon my open palm

‚ÄòWhat are you thinking with such penance?‚Äô
She asked, her voice as ever so sweet
‚ÄòWhere does your mind fly away with leaves?
While your eyes fixed upon my seat?‚Äô

‚ÄòJust wondering, the if-maybes,‚Äô I replied
What keeps us so attached together
Is it foolish love or just current happiness
That we say to bind us forever?

What if you had to choose? I asked
Between loving me or staying in happiness
What if loving me brings you all the sadness I got to face,
While staying away could save you all that crappiness?

What if in the life ahead? All that is written for me is a sad endless?
What will you choose in life this uncertain? Happy-Security or defenseless?

And think about it before replying.
No cliches like ‚ÄòWe will face it together.‚Äô
For what is love if not happy?
And yet it might stand against our love for one another?

--
Solemn look, Teary twinkle eyes,
Blush so red, redder than the leaves in sky,
And as if a contradiction to simply walk by
A glimmer of a smile, touching a falling tear from the eye.

Love is my certainty, even if your happiness is not
For how you define happiness is what makes it shine
And even if we face bad times, I will be your support
Just as before and tonight, you are mine.

And that is what actually matters.
That I am yours and vice versa, same
And no matter, if your sadness is endless, for you have me
Even infinite darkness gets dispelled with a small candle flame

So, pat your horses and still your mind.
And face alone your endless sadness
And ride through them with Time as your ally
For at the end, only I shall remain your one true foolish happiness

--
And such is love, for it should be
And rest is just fake temporary, mistook to be happiness
And scarred if you are from some dreadful experience 
Oh, how I wish you could have avoided that crappiness 

But know what you felt was just what the Time did beget
And what you are left with are some complex memories, difficult to forget.

29/06/23, 20:17 - Giridhar: Oops 
Sorry'
30/06/23, 19:05 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Do you know a funny paradox

Maturity can only come if you have brains
Your Brains can only develop if you read.
But people who read are willing to read only because they are mature.
30/06/23, 20:51 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: nice
saving it for my next travel
30/06/23, 20:58 - Devavrath S IITJ Bio: Maturity comes with age
You age as time passes
Hence, many reach maturity too late n miss fun parts of their life

But here comes da paradox, ppl strive for fun n end up maturing late , and the mature ones wanna have fun but cant
30/06/23, 21:07 - Hrishikesh Makwana IITJ ME: Not so sure of the age factor though. It's the mind that decides the timestamp.
30/06/23, 21:08 - Hrishikesh Makwana IITJ ME: Age is just a pretext. A cushion that gives us the liberty to enjoy and have fun.
30/06/23, 21:09 - Hrishikesh Makwana IITJ ME: It's when the mind realises the abyss of temptation that we attain maturity.
30/06/23, 21:13 - Prithvi Kiran IITJ CS: Wts maturity?
30/06/23, 21:13 - Prithvi Kiran IITJ CS: ~(Acc to u ppl)~
30/06/23, 21:15 - Shubh Goyal IITJ ' CS: Trying to be wise and responsible may be
30/06/23, 21:17 - Hrishikesh Makwana IITJ ME: When you take well informed decisions in life  and are aware of it's effects to society.
30/06/23, 21:17 - Hrishikesh Makwana IITJ ME: Often misinterpreted with philanthropy
30/06/23, 21:19 - Shubh Goyal IITJ ' CS: Should we deem our intrusive thoughts as immature? üëÄ
30/06/23, 21:20 - Hrishikesh Makwana IITJ ME: Maturity is an attribute of personality.
30/06/23, 21:21 - Hrishikesh Makwana IITJ ME: Thoughts are like the water in a river.
30/06/23, 21:21 - Shubh Goyal IITJ ' CS: Basically something related to brain
30/06/23, 21:21 - Hrishikesh Makwana IITJ ME: They source from the ocean of all possibilities.

30/06/23, 21:21 - Shubh Goyal IITJ ' CS: Then the people who submit themselves to intrusive thoughts must be immature üëÄ
30/06/23, 21:21 - Hrishikesh Makwana IITJ ME: Each river is an individual being into which the water flows.
30/06/23, 21:22 - Hrishikesh Makwana IITJ ME: Not as long as it does not affect their decisions in life.

30/06/23, 21:36 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Like dude I was like 
Gonna suck
But it actually behaves the way they were intended to behave
30/06/23, 21:36 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: The first chapter itself is *chefs kiss
30/06/23, 21:36 - +91 79035 57122: I saw the video it literally plays like the android, but doesn't it defeats the purpose of game?
30/06/23, 21:36 - +91 79035 57122: Android developing human feelings
30/06/23, 21:36 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: And all while being morally upright??
30/06/23, 21:37 - +91 79035 57122: Yeah
30/06/23, 21:37 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: I mean that's up to decide right??
The purpose of the game
30/06/23, 21:37 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: After all we never got to know what ra9 is
30/06/23, 21:38 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: ChatGPT just takes it a bug maybe?? Idk haven't been to that part yet
30/06/23, 21:38 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: But ha i get ur point
Lekin the decisions chatGPT was making were actually sound üíÖüíÖ
30/06/23, 21:39 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Peep DM
30/06/23, 21:43 - Devavrath S IITJ Bio: Age is the biggest role lol, an example is is
We thought that 11th 12th padhai krenge n chill hoga, but reality is not the same is it?

I think age is the major cause of the mind deciding the timestamp
30/06/23, 21:44 - Devavrath S IITJ Bio: Age is the barrier i feel, your mindset is the cushion. The older you are, more your body fails yoh (that is if you are fit rn)
Cushioning is done by our mind
30/06/23, 21:45 - Devavrath S IITJ Bio: If we implement, yeah üíÄ
30/06/23, 21:46 - Devavrath S IITJ Bio: When the "water" is calm n pleasant, thats when our mind is at peak maturity

I feel that probability of taking mature decisions increases with age.
30/06/23, 21:46 - Devavrath S IITJ Bio: Uhhh... the voluntary part id say
30/06/23, 21:47 - Devavrath S IITJ Bio: The state which causes the best decision to be taken id say
30/06/23, 21:47 - Devavrath S IITJ Bio: Could be the opp tbh, i feel we control the turbulance in the river, and life causes if
30/06/23, 21:48 - Devavrath S IITJ Bio: It is very hard in todays society lol
30/06/23, 21:48 - Devavrath S IITJ Bio: Send link

30/06/23, 21:50 - Devavrath S IITJ Bio: Is it like the black mirror movie?
30/06/23, 21:50 - Devavrath S IITJ Bio: Ahh  but don't gimme spoilers n get me biased!
30/06/23, 21:52 - Hrishikesh Makwana IITJ ME: No lol. What you give the example of is just the population that targets JEE and NEET. There are people out there that mature earlier and take up paths to serve their ulterior purpose.
30/06/23, 21:53 - Hrishikesh Makwana IITJ ME: Whoever taught our minds ki 11th and 12th padhai krni hai and chill hoga. We were fed this info. Our mind never independently thought the same.
30/06/23, 21:55 - Hrishikesh Makwana IITJ ME: That's again the perspective that says 
'The warm blood of youth will make up skip good advise just as a hare leaps over a trap.'
30/06/23, 21:57 - Hrishikesh Makwana IITJ ME: The age factor I think convinces our self that we are young enough. We will be given the lease in event of anything bad.
30/06/23, 21:58 - Hrishikesh Makwana IITJ ME: The water of thoughts will never be calm n pleasant tbh. You just get more conscious of them as you mature.
30/06/23, 22:00 - Devavrath S IITJ Bio: Yes, but those are decisions , they completely arent mature :)

They have calmed the turbid waters of their mind and planned the best future out
30/06/23, 22:00 - Devavrath S IITJ Bio: Haha i agree, although ive rebelled against this a few times, i still followed it
30/06/23, 22:01 - Devavrath S IITJ Bio: True true
30/06/23, 22:01 - Devavrath S IITJ Bio: Cant think rn, will text tmro lol, 102 fever messin me
30/06/23, 22:02 - Hrishikesh Makwana IITJ ME: Agreed. But here's where I connect it. When all your decisions are well informed you attain maturity. ü§≤
30/06/23, 22:02 - Hrishikesh Makwana IITJ ME: Lol ok. Will wait for your turn. üòÇ

01/07/23, 00:41 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: some of you guys should try this out
01/07/23, 00:48 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Ah remember this legendary shit
01/07/23, 00:50 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: A man is wise and completely responsible and perfectly capable, yet with an unsufferable habit of cracking poor jokes in the wrong places is he mature?
01/07/23, 00:52 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: I have taken a well informed decision that corporate brings work in life. So i shall stay unemployed also if I dont work it wouldnt affect the society at all. Am i mature?
01/07/23, 00:53 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Ah good question
01/07/23, 00:54 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: True. However is it just personality and not the way you conduct your life and the responsibilities you hold?
01/07/23, 00:55 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Damn. Then giving away money to charity is essentially a loss to me. Am i mature to not donate to charity?
01/07/23, 00:56 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: But what if you are immature and your intrusive thoughts are the mature ones?
01/07/23, 00:57 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: But is any person who calls himself mature according to his definitive standards, really mature?
01/07/23, 00:58 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: A very deep statement
01/07/23, 01:08 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: In my humble opinion, maturity is an expectation imposed on humans by society to take rational logical decisions within a given timeframe. When humans tend to take extra time to do so they are ridiculed by society. This is line with what Dev said.
However, the ability to take rational decisions can only come from experience and good experience can come from irrational decisions. All experience cannot be good. Sitting around for 50 years cannot make you a learned guy.

As it can be said that good judgement comes from experience and that comes from bad judgement.

So inturn the amount of maturity is directly proportional to the amount of immaturity in the younger ages. And the society gets impressed when they see the big difference in nature and ability. This is in line with what Shubh intended to say.

But what I say is that maturity comes when you learn to exploit others experience for your own benefit. Like for example if I listen to a mistake made by my predecessor and I am the one to learn from it, I have used their experience. So if I read an author and experience what they felt in some notion, it helps gain knowledge as equivalent to the actual thing.

But in today's day and age the reading population is significantly reducing. Hence my statement.
01/07/23, 01:09 - Aaditya Senior: sounds like a cushioned excuse
01/07/23, 01:09 - Aaditya Senior: validity n belief in anything comes down to a conformational bias
01/07/23, 01:11 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: True. And that can only come with an open perspective.
01/07/23, 01:11 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: And that is what I intend to highlight along with my original point.
01/07/23, 01:12 - Aaditya Senior: bro Your original point was 3 paragraphs

29/07/23, 04:03 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Contemplating III

I sometimes wonder 
Of how perspectives contrast
How one thing looks good to someone
And the other looks at the same aghast?

And what is this light that shadows my person?
What shadow deems favorable to one and to another not?
How something attracts some people to me and shoo away others?
How does a view of light change my person for the one or naught?

So, what should I do to embark on this positive radiance?
Make everyone happy, no one to be sad on my watch
Should I change my entire personality?
Endeavor to please while hiding my true self behind a torch?

But even that would be perceived in a negative light
A two-faced man, a hypocrite, a lie
And so, no matter to please, how much I try
Someone in this world would always wish that I die.

So, let us take an example of a simple emotion.
Perceived is darkly the act of pain.
For what could be good that hurts someone?
What pleasure could pain give to someone sane?

And yet lies a fact. Too deep within,
For every human born on this earth,
A mother existed to suffer the pain gladly,
Pain for the pleasure of life proved its worth. 

And even in death, the pain was imminent,
For every human who died caused pain
And the pain then proved its worth for remembrance
For the surrounding crowd suffered from an emotional strain.

So is Pain the positive? Or would you still call it negative?
It forces you to feel whether good or bad is entirely your perspective.
So why paste shadows and be discriminative?
Why let ‚Äòimages‚Äô make privy and decisive?

Why should light be the guide to saint or Satan?
Why should light paint the picture of hell or heaven?
And this is the irony as I paint this light in hiding,
What fault did the dark have to be called blinding?

For wouldn‚Äôt the blind be a better judge?
Free from prejudice, discrimination, or mistrust?
So, why mock the blind for their inability to access sight?
When drowned, is your entire person in all that light?

I only intend to make you realize this judgmental light
To shatter this prejudice to bits in front of your sight.

And so, I end with this last ask
What light would you bask upon this contemplating task?
Is it the positive dark or the negative bright?
Which shadow of mine will shallow your sight?

29/07/23, 04:45 - +91 93700 11656: I have reached a place
With no shadows or light
Yet everything is clear
Just as daylight

All my questions burnt to ashes
The answer were always in front of my eye
Yes I was a fool 
Who was trying to look beyond
With senses just five

I found a place where all contrasts died
For there were none, it was just my crafty mind
I have left my mind far behind
And fallen into a blissful abyss

Pain was a delusion
Laughed so hard when I found out
It was mind's another trick 
To not let me go out

Now I am beyond contemplation
For there is no judgement
As there is no mind
With such extatic bliss
Lost in the infinite abyss

29/07/23, 05:47 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: The thought process was unique and so were the phrases. 
What you can try though is to increase a bit of your vocabulary and rearrange your lines a bit. 

Like using words like light daylight, out and out again turns down the emphasis. Repetitive use of words like abyss and bliss and makes your composition less refined. 

Such improvements can only be achieved with practice and experience so keep going!
29/07/23, 05:47 - Aaditya Senior: short poems are lovely when fast paced
29/07/23, 05:48 - Aaditya Senior: i have made a few changes

10/08/23, 02:31 - Aaditya Senior: ```
Upon a snowy evening's fall,
I found myself within a gust;
A quaint retreat where shadows call,
A woodland dark, serene and just.

Through barren branches bleak and bare,
The moonlight danced upon the snow;
A wondrous sight beyond compare,
As nature's brilliance seemed to grow.

The winds sang softly through the trees,
Their whispered voices so profound;
Inviting me, if I would please,
To pause my journey, to be bound.

My weary steed, with frosty breath,
Beseeched me carry on our way;
But there, amidst the hush of death,
I yearned to linger, not betray.

My mind was torn, betwixt the two,
The draw of home, the woods' allure;
Yet time was ticking, as it flew,
My soul's decision, still unsure.

With every step that I did take,
My heart was heavy, burdened so;
For there, the woods no lip would break,
But secrets whispered soft and low.

The snowy depths engulfed my mind,
As ethereal silence reigned;
A solace oh so hard to find,
As weariness and want remained.

In shakespearean evocative verse,
My thoughts did wander 'round and 'bout;
To leave, to stay, my soul did rehearse,
In this deliberation, I devout.

But duty called, my path was set,
To leave the woods, to journey on;
Though lingering I did regret,
For home's embrace, I longed upon.

Yet deep within my beating breast,
The woods' allure forever clings;
A haunting truth, I must confess,
Of timeless beauty that it brings.

Thus, on this snowy evening's wane,
I bid farewell with heavy heart;
With longing glances back again,
To where the woods and I did part.

Leaving us in chaos , its idea of fun.

Gone at crucial moments , without a trace.
In trouble we find ourselves , thanks to its game,

19/08/23, 11:25 - +91 6392 494 304: Greetings IIT Jodhpur,
Its with great gusto, that I *Mitarth Arora* ,student of BTech Final Year from Electrical Department have thrown my hat in the ring for the *General Secretary of the esteemed Student Senate.*

Picture a campus, where wifi is as speedy as our vending spends and coffee flows like inspiration. 
Think of Labs on par with Fiction, and cultral events that put Carnivals to shame.

Now now, my SOP is not just ambitious words, theres a plan of everything.
Its a declaration of Future Adventures, from hosting nurturing workshops to making our mess food a talk of delicacy, I aspire to elevate our IIT Jodhpur experience in all aspects.

*Please find attached the detailed SOP for your kind reference to know my past work and future plan of actions.*

Few key highlights of the changes I want to bring are:

1.) Open Culture 
2.) More Food Vendors with Subsidized Prices
3.) Focus on Quality of fests rather than much in Quantity. 

And many more , Please go through SOP...

Help me paint our IITJ journey with camaraderie and a touch of rebellion.
Together, we'll turn ordinary into extraordinary. 

*Cast your vote for Mitarth Arora* - because when you choose me, you're choosing a symphony of class, and a sprinkle of wit.

*Let‚Äôs rewrite the Student Senate story one smile at a time.*

Of anxiety, agog and bated breaths
Ushers us into a new reign
Of widened horizons, novel ways.

In this space, where pens are swords
Spears of arguments adorn the wards
Where words play pun, books are adored,
Has begun a new chapter, as the sun has emerged.

We look forward to apprise uncharted seas
As we all embark on a new odessey
As the formers rest their hats this Friday
And hand over the helm to the new primacy.
25/08/23, 21:47 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: Every end is a new beginning.

25/08/23, 22:26 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: The *Sun* is bound on an onward journey
And the skies are swept in a darker mourning fade
But then twinkling stars show up, lighting skies
*Good Deeds* will make the night shine in a brighter shade

*Worth* is what defines a legacy
For the *Star* that comes in plays undeterred
For the *Richness* in speech and
For the *Progress* in thoughts.
For the *Happiness* in books and
For the *Cognizance* in worded clots

*Compassion* is important
for every thought to be lettered.

And *Realization* comes when you find
I have been playing with names of people again
Thus once again I achieve my *Aim* <This message was edited>

a million sun rays flickering
and a full moon yet to be veiled,

a start for the millions
begins with someone‚Äôs end of days.

With a pain of separation from my Litsoc responsibility and the overwhelming delight that I get to pass it on to such wonderful new people.

I wish all the new PORs and Cores the very best of luck.
26/08/23, 04:37 - Prithvi Kiran IITJ CS: In pages turned and tales anew,
The legacy lives, each word a clue.
The past entwines with futures bright,
Guiding hearts through day and night.

Congratulations people üéâ! But hold on, this is just the prelude to what I want to share üò≠. Ah, the intrigue intensifies doesn't it ? 

You see - a certain someone - has insisted to share it at a more opportune juncture.Patience has its virtue, they say, and I find myself bound by this request.

The future beckons, full of promise and potential, just like the unwritten chapters of a cherished book. Until the time is ripe for revelation, let's journey forward together, inkling in hand and mystery in the air.

10/09/23, 07:53 - Prithvi Kiran IITJ CS: In the realm of manga and anime, let's now explore,
An age-old debate that fans fervently implore.
Anime's got pizzazz, with scenes that are wild,
But manga panels, have a charm, undefiled.

With animations so fluid, anime takes the stage,
But manga's got secrets, like a hidden treasure cage.
It taps into our brains, like a memory spell,
Filling in gaps where our recollections often dwell.

Like a puzzle piece, manga's art takes its place,
Completing the picture with creative grace.
Our brains, just like manga, remember in kind,
Connecting the dots, like a brilliant mind.

It's not just about looks, though anime's a sensation,
Manga's stillness provides room for contemplation.
It gives you the freedom to pause and to dream,
As scenes transition in your mental stream.

Imagine the beauty of that creative dance,
As manga and mind find a harmonious romance.
Subtle and charming, like a sly little fox,
Manga and imagination, in a paradox.

So, whether you're in the manga or anime crew,
Both offer delights, that's absolutely true.
In the stillness of panels, thoughts take their flight,
Creating a magic that feels just right.

Prime examples : Berserk  and Tokyo ghoul

In the attic of our minds, do recollections gather dust or shimmer like hidden gems?
Moments woven into the fabric of our existence, are they threads binding or unraveling?

24/09/23, 01:40 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Dying Embers

As I walked out in the open alone, aghast,
Thinking back on the recent past.
To my gloomy thoughts in a paradigm,
Randomness in hurting and yet the ache in line.

And in my jungle thoughts in the wilderness
I did not feel the snowflakes piling fast
For it had begun snowing at a rapid pace
Temperatures down, and a cold wind blast.

Fearing frost for fatter fractions of my life,
Because death was cold, a common rife,
I picked two branches to reach up the cinder
And a fire sprang out, eating leaves and tinder.

And as I stood basking in the radiance,
The fiery wood compounded a soothing fragrance.
And then the sparks started above to fly,
Settling me down for the heat and dry.

And many of these sparks did emerge from the fire
Shooting up like tiny lasers in pure desire,
Matching pace with the falling snowflake
They ran toward them for the meeting's sake.

And the crackling sounds emerged like crust,
Laughing, living, loving the lust
And every crackle, a great epiphany
To my ears, a melodious symphony.

My thoughts now vanished in memorable perception.
Crackling happy times now in reflection.
And yet, something now felt like a rifle,
The deteriorating heat and the fire in a whistle.

For in the happiness that had transpired,
With every spark, a flake had conspired,
And with every crackle, a dead weight had accumulated,
Water had killed for what the fire had compensated.

And as if the world was playing a horrible joke,
The trance broke down, and my thoughts returned to provoke,
For my wounded heart made my eyes cry out, too,
All of this felt like a nasty D√©j√† vu.

Eventually, the fire died; no sparks emerged,
As if funny, over the wood, snow now converged,
And from the remnants of the heat of coal,
Embers crawled out, dying heart, body, and soul.

And thus, I knew from the clearing sky.
What I had lived was a big fat lie.
And yet, it wasn‚Äôt something to be scorned upon
It was time to learn and a high time to move on.

27/09/23, 01:45 - Shubh Goyal IITJ ' CS: Similar to it's "1 hr long" light updates
27/09/23, 02:38 - Prithvi Kiran IITJ CS: Is our agathokakological nature a blessing or a curse ? - do you it need to to be "alive" ?
27/09/23, 02:40 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: That depends on if you believe in duality in nature or singularity.
27/09/23, 02:42 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Cz while duality preaches that for good there will be bad, for every boon there will be bane and for every good there shall be evil to maintain a balance.
27/09/23, 02:42 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: It can also be seen in our culture where we say that sur and asur are two extreme ends of the nature.
27/09/23, 02:44 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: On the other hand singularity preaches that their is no balance, they are just two faces of the same coin, something like yin and yang represented together.
27/09/23, 02:45 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: In our words it is basically the dwaita and adwaita philosophies which have been at debate since a very very long time.
27/09/23, 02:47 - +91 89495 23832: But what is good or what is evil, that's something that is different for different people right
27/09/23, 02:48 - +91 89495 23832: So isn't duality kind of a flawed statement
27/09/23, 02:48 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Yup thats what singularity wala clause says they are attached together cz its difficult to differentiate between the two.
27/09/23, 02:50 - +91 89495 23832: Basically everything is about our own thoughts, if we think something is evil then anything that is against it is what we will assume to be good
27/09/23, 02:50 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Not exactly, while a dilemma may exist in case where wrong might get justified by a reason and not called evil, there are global events that are coined as evil. 
Something like what hitler did was evil and stealing a loaf of bread is also evil. Hardliner concept hai reason nahi sirf action dekhta hai.
27/09/23, 02:51 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: That is a very different concept of bias
27/09/23, 02:53 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Let me give a good example on this. If a murderer claims that he has been a good parent and have imparted good decisions except for the fact that he spent an entirety plotting to kill a particular person doesn't give him the right to be called less evil.
27/09/23, 02:53 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: I call it the Duryodhan Dilemma
27/09/23, 02:54 - +91 89495 23832: See, I agree with you but just think about it, see sometimes doing something to survive isn't wrong, right even if it is globally coined as evil
27/09/23, 02:55 - +91 89495 23832: Suppose there's a guy who wants to kill me, So if I kill him just to save my own life, do I become an evil ?
27/09/23, 02:55 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Then that is not seen as evil at all. And yes i do get your point.
27/09/23, 02:55 - +91 89495 23832: Hm I see
27/09/23, 02:56 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: And that is the Pandava defence. Nope not evil. According to duality. <This message was edited>
27/09/23, 02:56 - +91 93225 37551: Bhai meaning batado koiüò≠üò≠
27/09/23, 02:56 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Composed of both good and evil.
27/09/23, 02:56 - +91 89495 23832: Are like good and evil ka jo nature apn rkhte h na
27/09/23, 02:56 - +91 93225 37551: Achha
27/09/23, 02:58 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: But what do u mean by needing it to be alive.
27/09/23, 02:58 - +91 89495 23832: Duryodhan was considered good by his parents but he was globally an evil üíÄ
27/09/23, 02:59 - +91 89495 23832: Like not exactly good but their parental love clouded their judgementüò∂‚Äçüå´
27/09/23, 03:00 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Not just by parents. If read it u realize that he reared his kingdom as a regent very well for the years pandavas were in exile. He had a good reputation. But does that justify wanting to do away with your cousins since being a kid and not be called evil?
27/09/23, 03:03 - +91 89495 23832: Ofc not,  being good to one person and being bad to another person(while he has done nothing wrong) for no reason is kind of very wrong
27/09/23, 03:04 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: But that's us debating on the definition of evil, the question is that is evil present because good exists too?
27/09/23, 03:06 - +91 89495 23832: It may or may not like you said above
27/09/23, 03:06 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Like if u cull all evil the good goes out too and if don't be good there is no evil?
27/09/23, 03:07 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Itna duality?
27/09/23, 03:07 - +91 89495 23832: But I think that if we were to go into deep, then maybe its one emotion that creates the other one
27/09/23, 03:07 - +91 89495 23832: Like light only exists because there is darkness, right
27/09/23, 03:09 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Ah but yahan u speak of being interdependent but are they also indispensable? If there is no light will there also be no darkness?
27/09/23, 03:09 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: That is a strong point for singularity peeps
27/09/23, 03:10 - +91 89495 23832: Hm thats true
27/09/23, 03:12 - +91 93225 37551: Ah yes 
Adwaita meaning that you and god are one
Dwaita meaning god is different and you are different
I believe mankind has de-evolved from adwaita to dwaita... In the initial yugas, god and human was one and every yuga symbolised the increasing distance between the both.
Our duality in today's world is somewhat of a necessity to survive (not literally) in the outer world.
27/09/23, 03:13 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Was about to type this.
27/09/23, 03:14 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: So what dwaita says that god made the souls but he is not the same as us. And they thus worship god outside (in idols)
27/09/23, 03:15 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: The adwaita has the soham concept that as he is so are we. The soul is just a small water drop part of an endless ocean. They worship god inside ( meditation tapasya)
27/09/23, 03:15 - +91 93225 37551: Aah
27/09/23, 03:17 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: The journey then lies to start with the dwaita and progress towards adwaita. Grihast jeevan se sanyasi tak. Like as u enter a pool. U first walk in the shallow parts and then swim away in the depths.
27/09/23, 03:17 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: The debate itself though is endless.
27/09/23, 03:18 - +91 89495 23832: Its just that us humans(not all or maybe all, who knows) have always been in the shallow parts and never went into the deep parts
27/09/23, 03:18 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Even that is fine.
27/09/23, 03:19 - +91 93225 37551: Does suffering from someone else's bad deeds necessarily mean you are good?
27/09/23, 03:20 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Nope. Not wanting revenge for personal gain and fighting only for  what u deserve makes u good. All pandavas were reeled in and controlled by yudhishtir thats what held them in the good.
27/09/23, 03:21 - +91 79035 57122: I have quiz tomorrow and here I am reading all the arguments of you guysüò≠
27/09/23, 03:21 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: So ja
27/09/23, 03:21 - +91 89495 23832: Bro We have two quizzes ü´†ü´†
27/09/23, 03:21 - +91 93225 37551: Mere to 2 quiz haiüíÄüíÄ
27/09/23, 03:23 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Ok so arjuna asked how can I commit an action of killing my own kin.
The Lord said u can do it 2 ways. Consider yourself a medium and believe that I am the one doing it through u (adwaita) or do the action believing that I am responsible to look after you after they get done with. (Dwaita)
27/09/23, 03:24 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Doesn't matter if you don't change your philosophy with time. U will still be in grace.
27/09/23, 03:24 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Aisa was said.
27/09/23, 03:25 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: The only problem arises when people confuse beleifs with facts.
27/09/23, 03:25 - +91 89495 23832: Indeed
27/09/23, 03:28 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: So a person ended up killing an animal in rage but did not intended to do so. So he claimed that indra is responsible as he was in control of the hand. 
Then three days later when indra paid him a visit in disguise and praised his gardening skills he claimed that it was him who had done the job with his own hands and deserves the credit for it. Realized the hypocrisy and apologized. Basically u can't have it both ways. <This message was edited>
27/09/23, 03:29 - +91 89495 23832: Hm that's correct
27/09/23, 03:53 - +91 93225 37551: ooooooo
27/09/23, 03:54 - +91 93225 37551: basically everyone asks "God why me" when they are in trouble
but no one asks "God why me" when they are having a good time
27/09/23, 04:00 - +91 89495 23832: The once beautiful land had now turned into a horrible hell filled with corpses of humans everywhere on the battlefield. The sky had turned red due to the blood on the ground. The land which used to be filled with playful voices of children had now been filled with the evil cries of strix. 
In the centre of the land, a man could be seen, his body being pierced by many different weapons. 
The countenance of this man, even in his deathbed, was something entirely different from a normal dead man. 
On the nearby mountain, two creatures could be seen talking to each other. These had the same characteristics as the man but they were quite different from the man. 
Among the two men, one of them was wearing a white robe and had the countenance as that of an Emperor. 
The other man was wearing a set of armor filled with all kinds of runes, painted with blood.
"My lord, the Human Empyrean clan has fallen. Although, 5 of our generals lost their lives, the Human Emperor died in the end. Only some infants are, what is left of the mighty Human Empyrean clan. ", said the guy in the black robe. 
"What a pity!! In the end he died in our hands", said the guy in White robe, in a pitiful tone. 
"Erase the memories of those infants and cut off this dimension from Earth. The once mighty Human Empyrean clan that once ruled the land called Earth shall become a part of history and cease to exist." After saying this both the guys left from there. 

The Human Empyrean Clan had fallen. <This message was edited>

13/10/23, 18:48 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: But in all seriousness even businesses, jobs and industries have been declared satanic.
Many conspiracies fueled by confirmational bias say that many company logos are satanic.
Now is it the industries that are satanic
Or people getting too tired on Sundays to visit church make them fret a bit? <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 18:48 - Sukriti Goyal IITJ'CS: Bhay

13/10/23, 18:53 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: They can read scriptures
13/10/23, 18:53 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: It's often looked down upon to leave an open Bible Torah or Quran unattended
13/10/23, 18:53 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Why only in abrahamic?
13/10/23, 18:54 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Can Satan is an Abrahamic entity üíÄüíÄ
13/10/23, 18:54 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: And idk about other lore's
13/10/23, 18:54 - +91 89495 23832: maybe most of them are not satanic themselves, but who knows maybe behind one or two big companies, there might be cults which support themselves through the funding of these big companies and increase there influence
13/10/23, 18:55 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Declared by who??
Fanatics??
13/10/23, 18:55 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Are not in that sense say for devil?
13/10/23, 18:55 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: American churches during industrial revolution
13/10/23, 18:55 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Haa but beside Satan there are a bunch of fallen angels and other creations
13/10/23, 18:55 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: The bad guys? Jinn
13/10/23, 18:56 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: üíÄüíÄüíÄ

13/10/23, 18:57 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Modernism is satanic 
(Read: anything that is a departure from country side culture is satanic)
13/10/23, 18:58 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: (for conservatives?
13/10/23, 18:58 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Welcome to the fold blood brother into the cultural of conspiracies
13/10/23, 18:58 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: I would change my religion on Saturdays

13/10/23, 19:00 - +91 89495 23832: one day you are doing a job in the company, next day you are being surrounded by cultists who are performing some strange rituals and you are sacrificed to satan ü•∂‚ò†Ô∏è
13/10/23, 19:01 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Trivialising a little bit so sorry Greta
But most of the times we like to make victim out of ourselves
13/10/23, 19:01 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: How dare you?
13/10/23, 19:01 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Just to reinforce our core values, our beliefs
13/10/23, 19:01 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Now religion can get thoda sa controversial so for example
13/10/23, 19:01 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Women rights
13/10/23, 19:01 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 19:02 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: At no point in history was there a secret organization where men met every fortnight
13/10/23, 19:02 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: To discuss how to "systematically" oppress women
13/10/23, 19:02 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: And yet the systemic oppression existed
13/10/23, 19:03 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: "uk what?? My wife asked for me to not cheat?"
13/10/23, 19:03 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Nope never happened
13/10/23, 19:03 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: It's not the denial of rights. It's the non acknowledgement of them
13/10/23, 19:04 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: The secret society of men to push patriarchy openly
13/10/23, 19:04 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Thats what gets me
13/10/23, 19:04 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: No one said *women should not vote*
Rather it was hegemonic normalisation ki hey uk what women are not supposed to vote
13/10/23, 19:05 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Simple üë®‚Äç‚ù§‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®üòã
13/10/23, 19:05 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: It wasn't even that it was mode of a couple has a single vote thing... got misled along the way I agree <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 19:05 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Kinda same with our fascination of the supernatural
I mean if u do believe in a cult, believe in capitalism <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 19:05 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: And again here men meet every week
13/10/23, 19:06 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Not to discuss how to destroy ur culture
Or to brainwash you
13/10/23, 19:06 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: But to simply maximize profits
13/10/23, 19:06 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Or To chug a beer and take a break
13/10/23, 19:07 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Its a funny way to support capitalism though
13/10/23, 19:07 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Consumer is always right
Voter knows everything
And the other thing about the hand of free market
13/10/23, 19:08 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: But no
No cults
No secret societies
No holocaust
13/10/23, 19:08 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Considering capitalism is satanic ( source russian churches) .... lets return to the topic
13/10/23, 19:08 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Wait what?
13/10/23, 19:09 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: The historic meaning of holocaust wala holocaust üíÄüíÄüíÄ
13/10/23, 19:09 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Not the Hitler wala holocaust
13/10/23, 19:09 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Very sensitive time to phrase it like that <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 19:10 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: In same spirit as how jihad and allah'hu akbar are good expressions
13/10/23, 19:10 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Or even swastika
13/10/23, 19:10 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Ok this is a question i always wanted to ask is akbar the same akbar of the mughal empire?
13/10/23, 19:11 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è
13/10/23, 19:11 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Explain kar na re genuine curiosity
13/10/23, 19:11 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: U do realise that names can have meanings
13/10/23, 19:12 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: What is the meaning?
13/10/23, 19:12 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Great
13/10/23, 19:12 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: God is great is the translation
13/10/23, 19:12 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Ou
13/10/23, 19:13 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: And Humayun named his son Akbar
13/10/23, 19:13 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Lol to think such a simple statement gets to
13/10/23, 19:14 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Again it is important to call out people who misuse symbols and meanings for bad things
13/10/23, 19:15 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Misuse is a very ill word
13/10/23, 19:15 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: How so?
13/10/23, 19:17 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: I mean ofc Hitler with his pro-aryan agenda, would use swastika 
A symbol of purity
And not something like a skull or something that has negative connotations attached to it
13/10/23, 19:17 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: If he is same enough to use an evil symbol for his evil plans
13/10/23, 19:17 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Is he not sane enough to realise, what he is doing is evil????
13/10/23, 19:18 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: The issue is not the misuse of symbols
13/10/23, 19:18 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: The aryan thingy is a false theory in the Indian context i hope u know that.

Also he hid the facts for a major chunk of years I think 5.
13/10/23, 19:18 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: The issue is the killings? And the brutality
13/10/23, 19:19 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Yes and the misuse let me explain.
13/10/23, 19:19 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Will it be okay with you if fundamentalists used shaitan'hu akbar before blowing ppl up??
13/10/23, 19:20 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Arey let me type
13/10/23, 19:20 - Aaditya Senior added +91 99916 31405
13/10/23, 19:20 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: I aint saying they should not do it. I am saying others should call it out
13/10/23, 19:21 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Indian context??? 
I am talking wrt y Mr One Balls picked the symbol üíÄüíÄ
13/10/23, 19:22 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Okay I will let the others know
13/10/23, 19:23 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Like in the recent time example we see a guy masquerading a woman's dead naked body shouting the very same statement. Videographing it and posting it themselves. That creates a bias in doubt for others creates more radicals within fuels their effort to terrorize more. If not called out for what they are it gets even more sticker worse and wrong.
13/10/23, 19:23 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Bhay u here to roast me or what?
13/10/23, 19:23 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Kinda üò≠üò≠
I am sorry
I love you
13/10/23, 19:24 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Ha valid true
13/10/23, 19:24 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Ah but the swastika wasn't derived from the indian symbol it was a form of the cross.
13/10/23, 19:24 - Abu Shahid B20 IITJ: Reclamation of the symbols
Ig there is this support group in US which does the exact same thingy for swastika in US, especially during Diwali
13/10/23, 19:26 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Are read daniel brodman. He literally said that Canadians showed him and other jews pictures of antisemitism in India and the swastik photos and its the same for the entire west and if he hadn't known India before he would have been misled too.
13/10/23, 19:28 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Now returning to asur and rakshas...
13/10/23, 19:29 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Asur and sur are energies which create two distinct types of stimulus. While asur represents the negative formats the surs represent the positive ones. Balance is thus maintained.
13/10/23, 19:30 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Rakshas are those who act upon those negative thoughts and there actions lead major destruction in the physical or metaphorical sense.
13/10/23, 19:31 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: And soham arrived <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 19:31 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: Asur, daanav and rakshas are often misinterpreted for each other. Although it isn't the vase
13/10/23, 19:31 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: Case*
13/10/23, 19:31 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: They are used in enitrely different contexts
13/10/23, 19:32 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: Right
13/10/23, 19:32 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: Rakshas, dev and maanav are virtues.
13/10/23, 19:34 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Now when we say what devils or danav actually are... we need to see how the religion defines death?
13/10/23, 19:35 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: If taken in an absolute end kind of a thing we see it in a negative light and we end up relating it the devils themselves as soul snatchers or eternal damnations and so of the kind.
13/10/23, 19:36 - +91 89495 23832: So basically all of us have sur and asur inside of us, its all about who(person) is acting on who(sur or asur)
13/10/23, 19:39 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: On the other hand if you look at the concept of rebirth and paying for actions wala concept that more than 1 religion preaches btw. We see that it says the soul cannot be destroyed nor created for it is energy same as the creator itself. The name soham means that in the literal sense. So basically u might take a 100 rebirths or 1000000 rebirths but you will get salvation eventually. Here devil becomes subjective and debatable.
13/10/23, 19:39 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Yup
13/10/23, 19:42 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: In one sense the world is a platform where the good and evil collide and lives are the mediums through which it happens and the good will defeat the evil eventually.
13/10/23, 19:42 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Depends on what u choose to act upon.
13/10/23, 19:43 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: So even concepts like revenge, silence, non-action everything comes under serious purview
13/10/23, 19:44 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: @918949523832 why stop typing?
13/10/23, 19:45 - +91 89495 23832: I was thinking something, regarding this
13/10/23, 19:46 - +91 89495 23832: see you say that the world is a platform where good and evil collide
13/10/23, 19:47 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: And....?
13/10/23, 19:48 - +91 89495 23832: but what is this so called good and evil, more like why do they exist ?
13/10/23, 19:50 - +91 89495 23832: also are devils just an object to personify this so called evil or are they more than that ?
13/10/23, 19:50 - +91 83560 68082: Isn't that just covering the human part of the world tho? Seeing that morality,in general is more or less exclusive to humans. Animals, plants and other living beings don't have the concept of morality, they just survive
13/10/23, 19:51 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Two kinds of stimulus of energies classifying then as negative or positive. Say i call u an idiot, you get angry and your energy levels change, I call you intelligent you become happy and your energy levels change.
13/10/23, 19:52 - +91 89495 23832: also, suppose there exists a plane or dimension, which is just like the hell that we imagine in our lives, then what about that world ?
13/10/23, 19:52 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Ah but don't they?
13/10/23, 19:52 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Animals?
13/10/23, 19:53 - +91 83560 68082: Huh?
13/10/23, 19:53 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: What is morality how do u define it?
13/10/23, 19:53 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: That is a bold assumption. Considering that they also have humane qualities of love, affection, sorrow and so on.. it would not be wrong entirely to assume that they also have concept of morality
13/10/23, 19:54 - +91 89495 23832: hm, like if I were to be a plant, then won't I see humans as evil, but then the human race should disappear from the world right
13/10/23, 19:54 - +91 83560 68082: I meant like how you said the world is ring for the clash of good and evil, and we are the ones who fight
13/10/23, 19:54 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: The standards of that morality can be different but exactly what I wanted to say @918356068082
13/10/23, 19:55 - +91 83560 68082: I mean they don't have that level of consciousness
13/10/23, 19:55 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: Well then, herbivores would also think the same about carnivores. Do they disappear altogether ?
13/10/23, 19:55 - +91 83560 68082: What about bacteria and other microbes
13/10/23, 19:55 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: We as in all lives all species.
13/10/23, 19:55 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: See it is about maintaining that balance
13/10/23, 19:55 - +91 83560 68082: They for sure can't think of good and evil
13/10/23, 19:55 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Them to fungal and bacterial wars üòÇ
13/10/23, 19:56 - +91 83560 68082: Yes but i don't see bacteria, and other microbes fighting over good and evil
13/10/23, 19:56 - +91 83560 68082: Yss but aren't just those battles for survival?
13/10/23, 19:56 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: But they can think of survival. They will pick up traits that are useful for it and others to protect themselves from others.
13/10/23, 19:56 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: The balance between good and bad. It can be the good within me and the bad within me. It can be the good in the world around and the bad in the world around. 

Everyone's good and bad are different. (Well that might just deviate us towards the topic of situations.)
13/10/23, 19:56 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Yup yup
13/10/23, 19:57 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: But yeah.. when you say survival, the desire to survive in itself leads to balance
13/10/23, 19:58 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: The magnitude of good and evil in that fight is not to be equal at all levels. Thats why multiple births right?
13/10/23, 19:58 - +91 83560 68082: Even then that would not make the trait 'good'. It just happened to be useful in it's current scenario. It can happen that the same trait can wipe them out due to a new change in the environment
13/10/23, 19:58 - +91 83560 68082: There is no inherently 'good' or 'bad' trait
13/10/23, 19:58 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Thats evolution.
13/10/23, 19:58 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Great now u made it.
13/10/23, 19:58 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: I was waiting
13/10/23, 19:59 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: .
13/10/23, 19:59 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: Read the last sentence @918356068082
13/10/23, 19:59 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: And now we return to the life long debate of the dwaita and adwaita debate.
13/10/23, 20:00 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: Classic
13/10/23, 20:00 - +91 83560 68082: Then what would you define as a general good or bad
13/10/23, 20:00 - +91 89495 23832: you survive = good
something harmful for your survival = bad
13/10/23, 20:01 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: One sect believes in balance of 2 elements others says the presence of only one. We ve had this discussion before too if ya remember
13/10/23, 20:01 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Lol
13/10/23, 20:01 - +91 89495 23832: yupp
13/10/23, 20:01 - +91 83560 68082: Cause if everyone is using there own definitions,  we might as well just call it 'the balance of x and y', as we are allowing everyone to replace x with their own content
13/10/23, 20:01 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: If majority of a particular species/group believe that something works in their benefit, it is good for them. <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 20:01 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: The platform wala theory was zorastrianism waise.
13/10/23, 20:01 - +91 79035 57122: There was a law about internet that if you argue long enough on internet the debate will turn towards Nazis, in case of LITSOC it's dwaita and adwaitaüòÜ
13/10/23, 20:02 - +91 89495 23832: didn't you yourself just proved the credibility of my definition

13/10/23, 20:03 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: That is when u believe in zero sum. Like your good is my bad. But such is not the case mostly.
13/10/23, 20:04 - Soham Deshmukh IITJ'EE: Harsh here to take my place.. I take your leave.
13/10/23, 20:04 - +91 89495 23832: @918969958063 ....

13/10/23, 20:04 - +91 83560 68082: Bruh then what about random shenanigans we do that have nothin to do with our survival. What those come in, good or bad?

13/10/23, 20:05 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Hmmmm. Ok so not exactly personification but a form of energy. We are the mass forms of energy and thus prefer to worship or detest energies in the same format.
13/10/23, 20:06 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Like this convo <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 20:07 - +91 83560 68082: Well...personally I believe that we cannot really fathom the world. Like we can't even tell if my location and speed with a 100% certainty, then how come can we surmise the mechanisms of the world in a finite amount of text?
13/10/23, 20:07 - +91 83560 68082: Like what we are doin rn
13/10/23, 20:08 - +91 89495 23832: see, its time to flex the set theory that we learnt
13/10/23, 20:08 - +91 89495 23832: good union bad is not the universal set
13/10/23, 20:08 - +91 83560 68082: Emphasis on the 'really'
13/10/23, 20:08 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Again there are many philosophies in multiple religions and numerous in the Indian civilisation itself. Its debatable but not so good that we can make conclusions. And when u can't conclude u believe.
13/10/23, 20:08 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Same reply as above. Bye bye
13/10/23, 20:09 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Padhlo thoda ab

13/10/23, 20:09 - +91 89495 23832: then what is love, is it necessary for survival? maybe sometimes but not always
13/10/23, 20:10 - +91 83560 68082: I can easily say my room is A, and rest of the world is B. A and B make up the whole world. I need not understand B cause anything that happens in B will have to impact A to impact me. And as long as I understand A, I understand the world

17/10/23, 02:35 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Idle War

There was I, sitting under the sky, idle
For the war had passed after an eternity
Three and a half years spent in sweat and blood
In sickness and in health, had I spent with integrity

Those years had been supported by my peers in the blood
And the blood too had bound me in my scars
But it was the letters that kept me alive
Letters with words that kept me far from the farce.

And so, while the war wore on my feelings changed
Graduated with my Bachelor in Youth
And yet I hid it within my internal endless
For Lord did I fear the fruit

For if it went well, all was well, too
But a cold wind would bring a winter harsh
For then, the letters would surely stop 
And then no letters with words and words with letters
Would comfort me from drowning in the marsh

So held I did as steadfastly as I could
And kept a lid on this beautiful feelin‚Äô
And so, I fought a brave war outside
While having internal idle wars within

But now I sit under the idle sky
Beside the author of Comfort and Hymn
Only to realize the idle wars within her
Had clashed with mine rhyme to rhyme.

And so, I wonder as I breathe easy, bright
Perhaps what they say is right‚Ä¶
Just as entering the darkest of places shows you the faintest of stars
Hope only arrives when ‚ÄòRisk‚Äô is faced with your battle scars

18/11/23, 02:15 - Lakshya Nitin Tandon B20BB: Coffee?

When coffee finds a newer soul,
It leaves him dry with a bitter taste,
And then a few cups more here and there,
To find loyalty even in haste.

For the bitter taste might hold you back.
But the effects churn in to be a quick hitter,
Until a time comes in the night of work
And the bitterness soothes your brainy litter.

And thus, is acquired the taste of work.
Literally, the same as the taste of life,
And while a healthy dinner might await you home.
You cheat here with your bitter work-wife.

So, in this game of work now brews a life
And within them all, it is you I see,
For among all the rifles and strife, what I really want to ask
Do want to get with me and some coffee?
