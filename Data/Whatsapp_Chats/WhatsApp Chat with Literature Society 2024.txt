31/10/23, 13:22 - +91 93015 27509: Heyo guys sup
I'm *Aaryan Agrawal*, from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh. I'm an introvert who turns into an extrovert when given the mic, nd I like to read n write (poems, proses, short stories) a lot. Literature provides me the perfect medium to just slip into my own abyss and forget the world exists. I'm usually into psychological thrillers (currently reading 'The Woman in the Window')  but I'm aspiring to try all genres for exploration sake. My other hobbies include cycling & playing chess. <This message was edited>
